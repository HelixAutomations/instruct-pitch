# Premium Checkout Design Brief - iPhone Case Reference

## Paramount Goal: Premium Ecommerce Cleanness

Based on iPhone case checkout screenshots - the **cleanness and premium feel** is stunning and exactly what we need for our legal services.

## Context & Problem
- **Current**: Payment embedded in step 2 page - feels dated from design perspective
- **Client Expectation**: Paying thousands for premium legal service - needs to LOOK like premium service
- **Trust Factor**: People expect payment gateways to have load time - it's actually reassuring
- **Psychology**: Instant card input = dodgy. Proper gateway loading = legitimate

## Target Process Flow

### Page 1: Clean Onboarding
- **Style**: Mix of Typeform + current Cognito forms
- **Purpose**: Show it's not too long, gather client info
- **Feel**: Professional, not overwhelming
- **Action**: Click "Next to Pay" → launches dedicated payment page

### Page 2: Dedicated Payment Page (PRIORITY)
- **Style**: iPhone case checkout cleanness level
- **Purpose**: ONLY payment - super clean, focused
- **Design**: As simple as possible, premium feel
- **Trust**: Proper loading states, security signals
- **Layout**: Single purpose, no distractions

### Page 3: Results/Confirmation
- **Style**: Clean success/receipt
- **Purpose**: Confirmation and next steps
