# PaymentsV2 Implementation

This directory contains the Phase 1 implementation of the modern payment UX as approved in the audit plan.

## 🚀 Components Implemented

### Core Components

- **PaymentLayoutV2** - Trust-first layout with SRA ID 565557 and support contacts
- **PriceSummaryCardV2** - Prominent amount display for legal services
- **PreflightPaneV2** - "Setting up secure session" UX (800-1500ms) 
- **TrustStrip** - Compliance footer with T&Cs, Privacy links
- **PaymentFlowV2Complete** - Orchestrates the complete flow

### Infrastructure

- **featureFlags.ts** - Centralized feature flag management
- **index.ts** - Clean exports for all V2 components

## 🎯 Non-Negotiables Addressed

✅ **Trust Elements:** SRA ID 565557, support phone/email, T&Cs/Privacy links  
✅ **No Retail Artifacts:** Legal services only, no tips/discounts/shipping  
✅ **Pre-flight UX:** Secure session setup before card form  
✅ **Feature Flag:** All changes behind `PAYMENTS_UX_V2=true`  
✅ **Accessibility:** AA compliance, mobile-first, high contrast  

## 🛠️ Usage

### Feature Flag Setup

Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
VITE_PAYMENTS_UX_V2=true
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key
```

### Basic Integration

```tsx
import { PaymentFlowV2 } from './components/paymentsV2';

<PaymentFlowV2
  amount={15000} // £150.00 in pence
  currency="gbp"
  instructionRef="INS-2024-001234"
  legalService="Property Purchase Legal Services"
  description="Complete legal service package..."
  onSuccess={(paymentIntentId) => console.log('Success:', paymentIntentId)}
  onError={(error) => console.error('Error:', error)}
/>
```

## 📋 Next Steps - Phase 2

Phase 2 will implement:

- Enhanced PaymentForm with full Stripe Elements integration
- 3D Secure support via `automatic_payment_methods` 
- Complete server-side `/api/payments/create-intent` endpoint
- Result screen with comprehensive success/failure states
- Full telemetry logging

## 🏗️ Architecture

The implementation follows clean component architecture:

- **Separation of concerns** - Each component has a single responsibility
- **Feature flagged** - Safe rollback with `PAYMENTS_UX_V2` flag
- **Trust-first design** - Compliance and security prominently displayed
- **Mobile-first** - Responsive design for all screen sizes
- **Accessible** - AA compliance with proper ARIA labels

## 🔧 Technical Details

- Built with React 18 + TypeScript
- Styled with CSS-in-JS for component isolation
- Stripe Elements v2 integration ready
- Feature flag infrastructure with Vite env vars
- No styled-jsx dependency (using inline styles temporarily)

All components are self-contained and can be progressively enhanced without affecting existing payment flows.
