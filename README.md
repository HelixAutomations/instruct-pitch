# Instruct Pitch

This repository contains a small React client and an Express backend used to demonstrate a payment flow with Barclays ePDQ.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm

## Installing dependencies
Install backend and client dependencies:

```bash
npm install --prefix apps/pitch/backend
npm install --prefix apps/pitch/client
```

## Running the backend
The backend exposes a simple server in `apps/pitch/backend`:

```bash
npm start --prefix apps/pitch/backend
```

This starts `server.js` which provides SHA-sign generation and payment confirmation endpoints.

## Building the client
To build the React client:

```bash
npm run build --prefix apps/pitch/client
```

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview --prefix apps/pitch/client
```

Environment variables (e.g., Azure Key Vault secrets) must be configured for the backend before running in production.

### Upload Environment Variables

File uploads require the following settings in `apps/pitch/backend/.env`:

```
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=instructionfiles
UPLOAD_CONTAINER=instruction-files
```

These specify where the server stores uploaded documents in Azure Blob Storage.

### Document upload caching

The `DocumentUpload` component caches successful uploads in `sessionStorage` using
the client and instruction IDs. When the user navigates back to the upload step,
cached file information is loaded and files that were already uploaded are not
re-sent to the server. A small "Uploaded âœ“" label next to the file name shows
which documents have been persisted.
