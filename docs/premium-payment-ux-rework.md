# Helix Payments — Premium UX Rework Progress

**Date Created:** August 21, 2025  
**Branch:** stripe-v1  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

## Overview

Reworking the payment flow to feel premium, credible, and calm. Moving from legacy ePDQ/Barclays system to modern Stripe integration with trust-first UX.

### Goals
- ✅ Premium, calm visual design
- ✅ Trust signals and security cues
- ✅ 3-step flow: Summary → Payment → Result
- ✅ First-party Helix branding (no obvious third-party embeds)
- ✅ Stripe Payment Element with custom styling

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Working Components
- **Backend Integration:** `stripe-service.js`, `payment-routes.js`, `payment-database.js`
- **Frontend Service:** `paymentService.ts` with Stripe Elements integration
- **Basic Components:** `PaymentForm.tsx` (functional but not premium)

### ❌ Issues to Address
- **Legacy UI:** Current `Payment.tsx` still references disabled ePDQ system
- **No Premium Design:** Missing trust signals, proper spacing, brand consistency
- **Missing 3-Step Flow:** No structured Summary → Payment → Result progression
- **Basic Styling:** Current components lack premium feel

## High-Level Implementation Strategy

### 🎯 Phase 2: Full Premium Integration (Current)

**Objectives:**
1. **Replace legacy design** across entire application with premium layout
2. **Implement proper routing** with success/failure redirects for trust signals
3. **Create clean user journey** with minimal noise and clear progression

### Current Routing Issues
- ❌ No dedicated success/failure routes (`/pitch/20200/success`)
- ❌ Components reload in-place instead of redirecting
- ❌ Legacy design on main flow (`/pitch/20200`)
- ❌ Mixed UX between test page and actual app

### Proposed Route Structure
```
/pitch/[passcode]           → Premium home page (instruction entry)
/pitch/[ref]/payment        → Premium payment flow (3 steps)
/pitch/[ref]/success        → Clean success page (redirect after payment)
/pitch/[ref]/failure        → Clean failure page (with retry options)
/pitch/[ref]/requires-auth  → 3DS authentication page
```

### Trust & UX Benefits
- ✅ **Clean URLs** that users can bookmark and share
- ✅ **Clear progression** with obvious next steps
- ✅ **Reduced noise** by cutting out in-component reloads
- ✅ **Trust signals** through professional routing
- ✅ **Error isolation** with dedicated failure handling

## Notes & Decisions

### Design Principles
- **Premium over speed:** Small, purposeful delays are acceptable
- **Trust over brevity:** Show security cues prominently  
- **Continuity:** Never feel like leaving helixlaw.co.uk
- **Clarity:** Amount, purpose, and next steps always visible

### Technical Decisions
- Keep existing `paymentService.ts` as foundation
- Extend with `premiumPaymentService.ts` for enhanced UX
- Use Stripe appearance API for seamless styling
- Feature flag for gradual rollout
