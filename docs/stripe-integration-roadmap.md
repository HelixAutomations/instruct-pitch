- Update database schema if needed to store amounts consistently

**Files to Update:**
- `apps/pitch/backend/payment-routes.js`
- `apps/pitch/backend/payment-database.js`
- `apps/pitch/backend/stripe-service.js`
- Frontend payment components

### 1.2 Business Logic on Payment Success

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE webhook_events (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    metadata JSON,
    processed_at TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending'
);
```

### 2.2 Event Replay System
**Priority:** Low  
**GitHub Issue:** [Link needed]

  'authentication_required': 'Please complete card authentication to proceed.'
};
```

### 3.2 Retry & Back-off Strategy

  "timestamp": "2025-08-29T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "info",
  "event": "payment_created",
  "payment_intent_id": "pi_1234567890",
  "amount_minor": 120000,
  "currency": "gbp",
