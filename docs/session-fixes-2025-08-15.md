# Session Fixes - August 15, 2025

## Overview
This document outlines all the fixes and improvements made during the development session on August 15, 2025. The primary focus was resolving document upload JSON parsing errors and enhancing the user experience for passcode-based URL access.

## 1. Document Upload JSON Parsing Fix

### Problem
The document upload functionality was throwing "Unexpected token '<', '<!DOCTYPE'..." errors when the server returned HTML error pages (404/500 responses) instead of JSON.

### Root Cause
In `apps/pitch/client/src/structure/DocumentUpload.tsx`, the `uploadSingleFile` function was calling `await res.json()` on all responses without checking the content type first.

### Solution Applied
```typescript
// Before (Line 235)
const res = await fetch('/api/upload', { method: 'POST', body: formData });
const data = await res.json();

// After
const res = await fetch('/api/upload', { method: 'POST', body: formData });

// Check if response is JSON before parsing
const contentType = res.headers.get('content-type');
let data;

if (contentType && contentType.includes('application/json')) {
  data = await res.json();
} else {
  // Non-JSON response (likely HTML error page)
  await res.text(); // Consume the response body
  throw new Error(`Server error (${res.status}): ${res.statusText}`);
}
```

### Files Modified
- `apps/pitch/client/src/structure/DocumentUpload.tsx` (lines 235-250)

### Benefits
- ✅ Prevents JavaScript crashes when server returns HTML error pages
- ✅ Provides user-friendly error messages instead of cryptic JSON parsing errors
- ✅ Maintains upload functionality while gracefully handling server errors

## 2. Mock Server Upload Endpoint

### Problem
The mock server (`scripts/mock_local_server.js`) was missing the `/api/upload` endpoint, causing 404 errors during local development testing.

### Solution Applied
Added a mock upload endpoint that simulates file uploads without requiring Azure Blob Storage:

```javascript
// Mock upload endpoint to simulate file uploads without actual Azure Blob Storage
app.post('/api/upload', express.raw({ type: 'multipart/form-data', limit: '50mb' }), (req, res) => {
  try {
    // For mock purposes, just return a fake blob URL
    const mockBlobUrl = `https://mockblob.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/mock-${Date.now()}.pdf`;
    console.log('[mock] simulated file upload to:', mockBlobUrl);
    return res.json({ 
      blobName: `mock-${Date.now()}.pdf`,
      url: mockBlobUrl 
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('[mock] upload error:', err);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Mock upload failed' });
  }
});
```

### Files Modified
- `apps/pitch/backend/scripts/mock_local_server.js`

### Benefits
- ✅ Enables full document upload testing in local development
- ✅ No dependency on Azure Blob Storage for development
- ✅ Returns realistic mock responses for UI testing

## 3. Enhanced Passcode Mapping

### Problem
The mock server needed to support passcode 59914 mapping to ProspectId 27367 for testing zero-amount deals and document upload visibility.

### Solution Applied
Extended the `mockDeals` array with the required mapping:

```javascript
const mockDeals = [
  { ProspectId: '12345', Passcode: '87402', Status: 'OPEN', Amount: 1200, ServiceDescription: 'Advice' },
  { ProspectId: '54321', Passcode: '99999', Status: 'CLOSED', Amount: 800, ServiceDescription: 'Litigation' },
  // Added mapping for passcode 59914 → ProspectId 27367 (zero amount to exercise documents step logic)
  { ProspectId: '27367', Passcode: '59914', Status: 'OPEN', Amount: 0, ServiceDescription: 'Consultation' }
];
```

Also added the missing endpoints:
- `/api/getDealByPasscodeIncludingLinked` - For passcode lookup
- `/api/internal/fetch-instruction-data` - For client data prefill

### Files Modified
- `apps/pitch/backend/scripts/mock_local_server.js`

### Benefits
- ✅ Supports testing of zero-amount deals showing document upload steps
- ✅ Enables passcode-only URL access testing (http://localhost:4000/pitch/59914)
- ✅ Complete API endpoint coverage for development testing

## 4. Previous Session Context

### Background Fixes Already Applied
From previous sessions, the following fixes were already in place:

1. **Empty CID API Parameter Validation** - Added validation in `IDAuth.tsx` to prevent API calls with empty clientId/passcode
2. **Document Upload Step Visibility** - Modified `HomePage.tsx` to always show document upload regardless of deal amount
3. **Passcode-Only URL Routing** - Enhanced `App.tsx` to handle direct passcode URLs like `/pitch/59914`
4. **Vite Proxy Configuration** - Updated proxy target from port 3000 to 4000

## 5. Testing Environment

### Server Configuration
- **Backend Mock Server**: Port 4000 (with full API endpoints)
- **Frontend Dev Server**: Port 5173 (proxies `/api` requests to port 4000)
- **Azure Functions**: Port 7071 (partial - Key Vault functions fail as expected)

### Test URLs
- Primary testing: `http://localhost:4000/pitch/59914`
- Frontend dev: `http://localhost:5173/pitch/59914`

### Passcode Test Cases
- `59914` → ProspectId `27367` (Amount: £0, Consultation)
- `87402` → ProspectId `12345` (Amount: £1200, Advice)

## 6. Email Template Enhancement (Discussed)

### Client Success Message Improvement
Proposed enhancement to make the confirmation message more professional:

**Current:**
> "We confirm receipt of your instruction HLX-XXX-XXX and payment of £XXX for your matter. We will be in touch shortly to confirm the next steps."

**Proposed:**
> **Thank you for confirming your instructions.**
> 
> We have emailed you a confirmation for your reference, and no further action is required from you at this time.
> 
> Your instruction reference is **HLX-XXX-XXX** and we have received your payment of £XXX for [service].
> 
> The solicitor now has your file and will handle the next steps. We will be in touch shortly to progress your matter.
> 
> Thank you for choosing Helix Law.

**Note**: This enhancement was discussed but not implemented as the user undid the changes.

## 7. Summary of Active Issues Resolved

| Issue | Status | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Document upload JSON parsing errors | ✅ Fixed | Added content-type checking before JSON parsing |
| Missing `/api/upload` endpoint in mock server | ✅ Fixed | Added mock upload endpoint |
| Passcode 59914 mapping missing | ✅ Fixed | Added to mockDeals array |
| Missing API endpoints for passcode lookup | ✅ Fixed | Added getDealByPasscodeIncludingLinked and fetch-instruction-data |
| Zero-amount deals hiding document upload | ✅ Previously Fixed | HomePage.tsx modifications from earlier session |

## 8. Files Modified in This Session

1. `apps/pitch/client/src/structure/DocumentUpload.tsx`
   - Added content-type checking for upload responses
   - Improved error handling for non-JSON responses

2. `apps/pitch/backend/scripts/mock_local_server.js`
   - Added `/api/upload` mock endpoint
   - Added passcode 59914 → ProspectId 27367 mapping
   - Added `/api/getDealByPasscodeIncludingLinked` endpoint
   - Added `/api/internal/fetch-instruction-data` endpoint

## 9. Development Workflow

### To Test Document Upload Fix:
1. Start mock server: `cd apps/pitch/backend && node scripts/mock_local_server.js`
2. Start frontend: `cd apps/pitch/client && npm run dev`
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:4000/pitch/59914`
4. Complete workflow to document upload step
5. Test file upload - should handle errors gracefully

### To Test Passcode-Only URLs:
1. Direct access: `http://localhost:4000/pitch/59914`
2. Should auto-detect passcode, lookup client ID, and proceed without manual authentication
3. Document upload step should be visible despite zero amount

## 10. Future Considerations

- Monitor production for similar JSON parsing issues in other API calls
- Consider implementing global error handling for all fetch calls
- Document upload could benefit from progress indicators for large files
- Consider adding retry logic for failed uploads
